This App is designed to store boxer details into a database. The purpose of this app is to aid proper matchups between clubs and make this more efficient when it comes to matching up boxers. It records the boxer name, club and weight and an optional picture. The final build will implement a map of the country in which you can view other clubs boxers info and require a sign in to allow changes to your specific club records.
